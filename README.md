There are two code files('*.ino' and '*.py').
The final code for arduino should be run in arduino ide (1st cretate your own file then copy paste the code, will not give error by following this).https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software

The rpi final code should be run in raspberry pi through terminal (the file is in python, can be used as it is by making minor adjustments).

Pre-requisites: get your api from any site, mine was from THINGSPEAK.
