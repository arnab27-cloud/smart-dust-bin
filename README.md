# smart-dust-bin
There are two code files('*.ino' and '*.py').

Software:
1.The final code for arduino should be run in arduino ide (1st cretate your own file then copy paste the code, will not give error by following this).https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
2.The rpi final code should be run in raspberry pi through terminal (the file is in python, can be used as it is by making minor adjustments).

Pre-requisites: get your api from any site, mine was from THINGSPEAK.

Hardware:
1.Arduino nano as many as you like. For budget used only one.
2.Raspberry pi zero w(has necessary bluetooth and wifi).
3.A dust-bin preferably plastic(easy to modify).
4.A power source for arduino and raspberry pi. For convenience used battery bank as it has multiple usb ports can power bth simultaneously.
