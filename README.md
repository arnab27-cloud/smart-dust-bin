# smart-dust-bin
There are two code files('code_arduino.ino' and 'raspberry-pi_code.py').

Software:
1.The "code_arduino.ino" should be run in arduino ide (1st cretate your own file then copy paste the code, will not give error by following this).https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
2.The "raspberry-pi_code.py" should be run in raspberry pi through terminal (the file is in python, can be used as it is by making minor adjustments).

Pre-requisites: get your api from any site, mine was from THINGSPEAK.

Hardware:
1.{Arduino nano*1, lcd display(16 pins)*1, HC-05(bluetooth)*1, mpu-6050(gyroscope)*1,lm35(temperature)*1,soil moisture*1,hc-sr04(ultrasonic)*1} as many as you like. For budget used only one set.
2.Raspberry pi zero w(has necessary bluetooth and wifi).
3.A dust-bin preferably plastic(easy to modify).
4.A power source for arduino and raspberry pi. For convenience used battery bank as it has multiple usb ports can power both simultaneously.
